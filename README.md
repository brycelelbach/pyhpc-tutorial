Python in HPC Tutorial  
=============================================

Python is a versatile language for the HPC community, with tools as diverse as
visualizing large amounts of data, creating innovative user interfaces, and
running large distributed jobs. Unfortunately, Python has a reputation for
being slow and unfit for HPC computing. HPC Python experts and Shaheen's sixty-five
thousand cores disagree. As HPC increases its vision to big data and
non-traditional applications, it must also use languages that are easier for
the novice, more robust to general computing, and more productive for the
expert.

Using Python in a performant way moves HPC applications ever closer to
these goals. This success has made Python a requirement for supporting users
new to the HPC field and a good choice for practitioners to adopt. In this
tutorial, we give students practical experience using Python for scientific
computing tasks from leaders in the field of Scientific Python. 

Topics include linear algebra and array computing with NumPy, interactive
and parallel software development with IPython, performance and painless
low-level C linking with Cython, and the friendliest performant interfaces to
MPI available.
